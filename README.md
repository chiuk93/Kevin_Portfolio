#Bitcoin Dashboard (Inspired by Coinbase UI)
* Developed an automated dashboard on Tableau Public that tracks on-chain metrics for Bitcoin: including circulating supply, total supply on exchanges, inflation rate, hash rate, stock-to-flow, google search trends, etc.
* The goal of this dashboard is to demystify Bitcoin for friends who believe Bitcoin does not have intrinsic value.
* Dashboard refreshes daily automatically with data extracted from Glassnode API automated using Google App Script

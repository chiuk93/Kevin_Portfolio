# [Bitcoin Dashboard (Inspired by Coinbase UI)](https://tabsoft.co/3HJIoBg)
* Developed an automated dashboard on Tableau Public that tracks on-chain metrics for Bitcoin: including circulating supply, total supply on exchanges, inflation rate, hash rate, stock-to-flow, google search trends, etc.
* The goal of this dashboard is to demystify Bitcoin for friends who believe Bitcoin does not have intrinsic value.
* Dashboard refreshes daily automatically with data extracted from Glassnode API automated using Google App Script.

# Trading Dashboard
* Developed a trading dashboard in Google Sheets for an investment club that I co-founded that tracks key performance metrics: including total realized return, total unrealized return, win rate, loss rate, assignment rate, etc.
* All trading data are extracted via TD Ameritrade API and refreshed automatically daily using Google App Script.
* Built automation in Google App Scipt to process and audit trades to ensure data accuracy for tax reporting purposes.
